This occurrence is not wrong. Dense fogs and heavy snows can produce values near zero. Fog, smoke, heavy rain and other weather phenomena can reduce visibility to near zero miles or kilometers.

        windSpeed:

          items: {}
          description: The wind is treated as a vector; hence, winds must have direction and magnitude (speed). The wind information reported in the hourly current conditions corresponds to a 10-minute average called the sustained wind speed. Sudden or brief variations in the wind speed are known as “wind gusts” and are reported in a separate data field. Wind directions are always expressed as from whence the wind blows meaning that a North wind blows from North to South. If you face North in a North wind the wind is at your face. Face southward and the North wind is at your back.
