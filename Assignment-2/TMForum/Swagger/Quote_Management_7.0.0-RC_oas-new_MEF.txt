  title: Quote Management
  description: "**This file forms part of MEF 115**\n\n**This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to change.** \n\nMEF-LSO Sonata Quote API allows to manage quote request & completion management between **Seller** and **Buyer**.\n\n3 different types of quotes are managed:\n- **Budgetary**: A quote that is provided quickly and with very little analysis such that the Buyer can get an idea of how much the requested Product Offering could cost.  Monthly Recurring Charges and Non-Recurring Charges, if specified, are subject to change. \n\n- **Firm – Subject to Feasibility Check**: A quote that is provided to the Buyer based on some, but not a complete, pre-order analysis.  At this stage, there is further analysis that the Seller can (and is willing) to undertake to provide a committed or firm price, but the Sell-er needs more time to complete this or the Seller may request that the Buyer use the Firm – Subject to Feasibility Check Quote to proceed to the Order process. Ordering may be possible based on the Firm – Subject to Feasibility Check Quote with some stipulations as to how cost identified during delivery is addressed. The Monthly Recurring Charges specified in the Quote Response are final.  Non-Recurring Charges specified in the Quote Response are subject to change.\n\n- **Firm**: A quote provided to the Buyer based on a pre-order analysis. All Monthly Recurring Charges and Non-Recurring Charges specified on a Firm Quote are committed.  A Firm Quote may expire at some date specified by the Seller.  \n\nQuote API has been designed by MEF basing on TMF 648 v4.0.0\n"
